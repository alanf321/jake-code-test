Step 1. List Users (Frontend)
We need to pull the information from the JSON file into a HTML page and list out the people and their details using either jQuery or Angular.js (preferred). For this task you must:

Create a HTML file that contains your JS and CSS in-line.
Pull the data from the people.json file as a GET request.
List out the data onto the page in the styling shown below.

Notes:
Used jQuery
Placed css internally in document head for ease of use.
